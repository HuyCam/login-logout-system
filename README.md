## Warning before run deploy this app
In the config folder there is a JWT_SECRET=somekey. You should change this key before starting developing this repos. It is not neccessary to change it. I just want you to take notice that since this is secret key, it should be a key only you or your dev team knows. Especially when you deploy it online.
